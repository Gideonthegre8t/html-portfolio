<h1>The Best Movies According to Gideon</h1>

<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>The Idol</h3>
<P>This is my favourite series of all time because it's about music, and it's just five episodes, that's what makes it perfect.</P>

<h3>Entergalactic</h3>
<p>This is the best animation movie I love asides from Gammy and the living things, because the animation style is dope, and the main character looks like me.</p>

<h3>Arcane</h3>
<p>Arcane has one of the most epic scenes I have seen in the animation industry, and it's a series, it's amazing. </p>
